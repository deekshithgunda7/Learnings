The internet is not a fuzzy cloud. The internet is a wire, actually buried in the ground. Computers connected directly to the internet are called "Servers," while the computers you and I use are "clients," 
because they are not connected directly to the internet, but through an Internet Service Provider. Routers shuttle packets of information across the 
internet, and transmit e-mail, pictures, and web pages.

As you might notice, when we browse the Web with a Web browser, we usually use the domain name to reach a website. 
Does that mean the Internet and the Web are the same thing? It's not that simple. As we saw, the Internet is a technical infrastructure 
which allows billions of computers to be connected all together. Among those computers, some computers (called Web servers) can send messages intelligible
to web browsers. The Internet is an infrastructure, whereas the Web is a service built on top of the infrastructure.
It is worth noting there are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and IRC.
